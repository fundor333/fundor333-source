WE DO NOT STORE ANY DATA.

We physically can’t.  We have nowhere to store it.  We don’t even have a server database to store it.  So even if Justin Bieber asked nicely to see your data, we wouldn’t have anything to show him.

We’re doing away with logging bug reports and solely relying on the Google Play Analytics for debugging and event tracking.
