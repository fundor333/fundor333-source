If you ever use _Unix_ based system you are familiar with _dotfiles_ for configuration.
Any program has some of this file or folders laying arrount in your user root.

And many time it was a booring job to setup all your stuff before starting with all the work because I want the config to be the same every where I work.
So, in the end of the 2017 i find an article about dotfiles: [Managing your Dotfiles](https://www.anishathalye.com/2014/08/03/managing-your-dotfiles/).
With this article and some _copy-and-paste_ from other dotfiles repo's on Github I made [mine](https://github.com/fundor333/dotfiles).
This was in November 2017. Github suggest it was the 20 my first repo but I remember I was trying multiple idea of it and only later make a repo with clean code.

Now some time has pass and I have a **_BIG FAT PROBLEM_**. I need to have my _dotfiles_ synced and working on a _Linux Machine_ (Arch), an _Apple Machine_ and a _Windows Machine_
