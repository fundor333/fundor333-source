Title: GraphQL and working with it
Summary: This is an article about the future of the api: GraphQL. This is the natural evolution from the REST API and it's the best thing for request only part of the data in the API

What is a REST API? REST stand for **Representational state transfer** (**REST**) or **RESTful** web services and it's the most used tipe of API you find online.

If I need some data I need to go to the url of the API and go to the _subpath_ of the data I want. 

For example if I need some posts from _https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/_ I need to go to _https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts_ and download all the posts or pass the id in the url like in _https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1_. Some time I will need only fews posta but the api give me all or one so it's can be some heavy lifting for the connection. And I need to know all the url and the params needed for the datas.

This is why  Facebook in 2012 develop **GraphQL**
