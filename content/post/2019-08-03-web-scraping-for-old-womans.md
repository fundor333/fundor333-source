description: Web scraping explained to a granny. All in python? No, without a language because if you know how you can do it
---

One day I showed the power of internet to my granny. 
It was a strange experience because I need to find something for her online and I want to get it scraping.

So i am writing this post.

First: what do you want to scrapy from the web?
This is a very difficult question for *a* granny. 

Fist, a lot of grannies didn't understand *the net* or *the internet* and what you can find on the net. 

Second you need to give her something of value for her day to day life if you want to impress her.

So I find her some Knitting Patterns! And I found a *__lot__* of site with _free_ knitting patterns so I choose a site for start the scraping.

Ok it's look like something too obvious for a granny to love knitting but remember: also Dumbledors *loves* knitting.
