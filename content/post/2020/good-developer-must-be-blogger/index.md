I find the way to become a good programmer: 

> Write a Blog about what are you doing

I see more and more good programmers have good blog and good blog about programming have good author.

After studing somee good blog and some bad blog I came with this list

> You need to write a blog about what you know. 
>
> You must keep it updated.
>
> You need to research for it.
>
> You need to read other blogs.
