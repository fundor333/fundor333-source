description: "Why someone need a server and how I build mine"

More time pass more time I need a server for my cronjob and other process. 
Sometime the cron was a supid thing, working only for the short period and after can be trashed but the real problem start with Feedly, the subscription for feed I use.

One day, adding a new feed to my Feedly account, I discovered that I can't add more in the free subscription. 
So I start thinking some alternative.

## What I need

* __web app__ i need to use on the run, not only in my machine but in other as well.
* __auto update__ I need to find the newer or the newest post from my feed
* __feed from wep page__ I need to have the feed from an url not only from the feed url
* __mark read and not read__ because I need to read only the new stuff and not only the old one
