description: Why you can find a Mew under a truck
---

This is a story about a myth about how to find Mew[^1].

In the old day without interent *"the cousin of a friends"* or a *" friend of my cousin* find and captured a Mew.

# The Myth
If you want to do it yourself you need to:

1. Have a Pokemon with *Surf*
2. Have a Pokemon with *Strength*	
3. Have the SS Anne not leave because the player doesn't have HM01 Cut

If you use *Surf* in the SS Anne map you can go to the track.

After you are near the truck you need to use *Strength* and Mew will spaw.
Like in this gif.
